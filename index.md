## Welcome

My name is Kiley Hewitt. I am a Junior double majoring in Computer Science and Biology at Allegheny College. I am very interested in the interdisciplinary applications of Computer Science in research and in product design. As a board member of Women in Science and Association for Computing Machinery, and as a fairly regular participant in academic department and other community events, I am also passionate about Science outreach and building community around Science. I am looking to build my experience in interdisciplinary areas of Science through research and internships throughout my undergraduate education before attending graduate school for a subject related to Computational Biology.
