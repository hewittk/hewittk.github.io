## About me

I designed a website about my professional and educational skills and interests using Google Pages. This site highlights my interdisciplinary interests and my experience so far thourgh projects, research, and other opportunities mentioned in my welcome section and resume. It also gives users the means to contact or find out more about me through links to my Linkedln, Github, and email address.
